Question 3

Enter first integer value(dividend): 56
Enter second integer value(divisor): 7

Quotient: 8 
Remainder: 0
Part a

Check whether the function (divmod()) is callable or not:
True, which means it is callable
Part b

Check whether all the values are zero or not:
All values in result(i.e. quotient and remainder) are not non-zero(i.e. one of them is 0).
Part c

Add (4,5,6) to the result and filter out values greater than 4:
Values greater than 4(in list format) are: [5, 6, 8]
Part d

Convert the above result into a set datatype:
The output of previous part in set datatype would be: {8, 5, 6}
Part e

Make the set immutable:
The immutable set would be: frozenset({8, 5, 6})
Part f

Evaluate the maximum value from the set and find out its hash value:
The maximum value from the set is: 8
The hash value of 8(considering it to be integer) is 8 and its hash value is -160963756(if we consider 8 as a string).
